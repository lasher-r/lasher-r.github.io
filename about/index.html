<p>I am a software engineer. I work for a company called Nobrolla. It&rsquo;s a company that my father and I started. It was originally a weather app and you can probably still find posts by our old twitter bot that tweeted rain alerts to baseball fandoms.</p>
<p>At an early point in development my brother joined us and we had a nice little family business going.</p>
<p>I was working out of my father&rsquo;s <em>real</em> office when their contact at Tribune broadcasting was on speakerphone and mentioned that they needed an Android app to replace Google Latitude that was losing some functionality (soon it would be discontinued and replaced by Google+). I jumped at the chance and the project became sort of my entrance exam to work on contract programs as a CDR employee.</p>
<p>I started working for CDR and by extension Tribune and Nobrolla was shelved. My brother soon came with me.</p>
<p>I was working on some newsroom projects as a junior developer for some time before I made the jump to more &ldquo;skunk works&rdquo; jobs. I&rsquo;d develop some experimental features that would be wrapped up into other projects or some smaller standalone projects that interfaced with our larger products. During this time my skill set ballooned, I was working on a variety of projects each with a unique problem set, stack, technology, and team.</p>
<p>Soon I was given the opportunity to be half of the lead on a new, bigger project. I was excited to work on it and although I was locked into a stack from orders on high, I was excited about the technologies we could leverage. The product worked fine. I don&rsquo;t know the current state of it but I imagine it died for reasons outside of the product itself. It was good, some people even seemed excited about it, but I wasn&rsquo;t particularly proud of my input. The architecture became confused, my code was an untested swamp of potential bugs, and a lack of effective collaboration led to a lot of ad hoc api methods tacked on.</p>
<p>The best thing to come out of the daybook was a serious pruning of my unknown unknowns. A personal post mortem of my second project-as-exam led me to discover what would be put into words by Sandro Mancuso as &ldquo;How it is done is as important as getting it done&rdquo;. I did everything I could so that I&rsquo;d be in a position to ace the next chance I had.</p>
<p>I was given another opportunity to co-lead in a slightly smaller capacity when we created a new product. I worked mostly as devops and as the instigator for some minor, though painful to some, process changes. We went to a more modern stack, moved to a real VCS, used containerization and cloud services, and implemented CI/CD. I also lead in training sessions for Tribune engineers who would install and configure systems and tain end users.</p>
<p>The new project required some special hardware that CDR was not well suited to purchase, build, store, and ship. Nobrolla came of the shelf to handle hardware needs as a separate company.</p>
<p>Over the next few years, for various reasons, CDR waned and Nobrolla waxed. Now Nobrolla is full time work and I work as a senior engineer working on devops and backend development as well as assisting anyone who needs it. I pushed for a more modern stack, process, and technologies. I&rsquo;m proud of the product we&rsquo;re building and am happy with <em>how</em> I work on it.</p>
<h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies<a href="#hobbies" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>In a previous life I was an avid backpacker. Somewhere along the line I stopped backpacking and I missed it. I recently got back into it.</p>
<p>I am also a maker. I joined a makerspace in Broomfield so that I could have time and tools to work on personal projects. I&rsquo;m now the vice president of the space.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an endless consumer of books. I read as much as I can and, if not for professional development, prefer memoir and fiction.</p>
