      <description>Background    My dad is rebuilding a 1929 Indian Scout motorcycle.
The problem is that it has no speedometer, odometer, or temperature guages and I need to build them.
Basics    I&amp;rsquo;m using a Metro Mini 328 as the brains. And a METRO 328 for building. The full size is nice because I have a couple each mounted to a breadboard and one with an oled display.</description>

      <description>Mt Eolus from Chicago Basin    Description    The trail head (8200 ft) is accessible using the Durango-Silverton narrow gauge train. We board at 0845. We get let off the train in Needleton at 1115. From there it&amp;rsquo;s a ~6 mile hike along Needle Creek to camp in Chicago Basin (11200 ft), just south of Twin Lakes. It&amp;rsquo;s likely that there will still be time left in the day so there is an optional trip up to columbine pass (12665 ft) to the south east.</description>

      <description>Bookshelf     This is a list of books that I find useful to have in mind while working. These are language and domain agnostic (C++ Coding Standards could be considered to be about c++ but it&amp;rsquo;s use is wider than just the language). Of course I have more reference books about languages and technologies but their use is so different than the ones listed here that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to include them.</description>

      <description>This is roughly my third iteration of my site. The first was essentially me shouting half baked ideas about software development into the void. The second was a repository for things that I need regularly but not often. Things like dot files for different types of machines, common shell commands that I don&amp;rsquo;t use everyday, and articles that cover questions that I sometimes get about the process of development.
I say &amp;ldquo;roughly&amp;rdquo; because as with many iterative processes, the transition from one category to the next is gradual with some regression and some spurts forward.</description>
