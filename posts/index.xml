      <description>This is roughly my third iteration of my site. The first was essentially me shouting half baked ideas about software development into the void. The second was a repository for things that I need regularly but not often. Things like dot files for different types of machines, common shell commands that I don&amp;rsquo;t use everyday, and articles that cover questions that I sometimes get about the process of development.
I say &amp;ldquo;roughly&amp;rdquo; because as with many iterative processes, the transition from one category to the next is gradual with some regression and some spurts forward.</description>
