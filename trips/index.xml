      <description>Mt Eolus from Chicago Basin    Description    The trail head (8200 ft) is accessible using the Durango-Silverton narrow gauge train. We board at 0845. We get let off the train in Needleton at 1115. From there it&amp;rsquo;s a ~6 mile hike along Needle Creek to camp in Chicago Basin (11200 ft), just south of Twin Lakes. It&amp;rsquo;s likely that there will still be time left in the day so there is an optional trip up to columbine pass (12665 ft) to the south east.</description>
